## Running the Script
It uses GPT-4 by default so you should have access to that to run it.

***Disclaimer:** This will use gpt-4 unless you changed it
not to, and by doing so it will cost you money.*

- **Configure Environment**: Copy ``.env.example` and set up the environment variables for [Browseless](https://www.browserless.io/), [Serper](https://serper.dev/), [SEC-API](https://sec-api.io) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
